Description: A tool to rectangle a nested list, that is to convert it into a
    tibble. This is done automatically or according to a given specification.
    A common use case is for nested lists coming from parsing JSON files or
    the JSON response of REST APIs. It is supported by the 'vctrs' package
    and therefore offers a wide support of vector types.
