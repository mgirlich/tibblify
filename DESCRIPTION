Description: A tool to rectangle a nested list, that is to convert it into
    a tibble. This is done automatically or according to a given
    specification.  A common use case is for nested lists coming from
    parsing JSON files or the JSON response of REST APIs. It is supported
    by the 'vctrs' package and therefore offers a wide support of vector
    types.
