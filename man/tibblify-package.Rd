\title{tibblify: Rectangle Nested Lists}
\description{
A tool to rectangle a nested list, that is to convert it into a tibble. This is done automatically or according to a given specification. A common use case is for nested lists coming from parsing JSON files or the JSON response of REST APIs. It is supported by the 'vctrs' package and therefore offers a wide support of vector types.
